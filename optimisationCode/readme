After extracting the kinematic growth rates from the deformation gradient field 
The aim is to use them for the optimisation process. 

The first objective is fitting 
The second objective is smoothness which is: 
       The Driver on this folder reads the kinematic rates, and then compute the gradient of them... 
       and compares the gradient with the gradient of the rates on each iteration ...
